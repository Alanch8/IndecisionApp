# IndecisionApp

<p>Backup repository for the IndecisionApp that is part of the Vue course.

By separating the application into a separate repository I can upload it into Vercel so that it can be tested from the outside.

It's a funny app that answers you with 'Yes' or 'No' to the questions you ask it.

Don't hesitate to try it! 😁</p>
